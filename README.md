## Introduction

Dojo coding is a meeting between several people who wish to work on a programming challenge collectively.
The challenge may be an algorithmic problem to be solved or a need to be implemented. Each dojo coding focuses on a particular subject, and represents the objective of the session.
There are different formats:

* Randori
Evenly rotating pairs (five to ten minutes) code the problem on the board.

* Prepared Kata
One person demonstrates to the rest of the group from scratch how to solve the problem.

The main interest of coding dojos is to learn new techniques, either through the knowledge of others, or by progressing together when faced with a problem. These sessions allow you to test and perfect techniques in a safe way, while sharing your knowledge with other members.
